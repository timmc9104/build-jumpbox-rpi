# build-jumpbox-rpi

## Purpose ##
The purpose of this repository is to store all of the code used to turn my raspberry pi into a jumpbox, PXE boot server, and ansible server for my home lab.  This "jumpbox" will primarily service my physical home server.  The aim is to be able to build out my home server and any labs with infrastructure-as-code (IaC).
